The Sheep Game Developers and each Purchaser may be referred to throughout this\nAgreement collectively as the “Parties” or individually as a “Party”. By purchasing or otherwise owning a Woolf,\nyou acknowledge that  you have carefully read and agree to the terms of this Agreement.<br/>\nThis website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By\nusing this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Sheep Game digital\ncollectibles.<br/><br/>\nYour purchase from The Sheep Game Developers or purchase from any owner of an NFT originally\nproduced by The Sheep Game Developers does not constitute a financial investment. You are buying a\npiece of art that lives on the Avalanche blockchain.<br/><br/>\nWHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE\nANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN\nIN COURT.<br/><br/>\n1. <strong>Agreement to Terms.</strong> “Woolf” refers to a non-fungible token (NFT) (i.e., a controllable electronic record\nrecorded on a blockchain) that, as of its genesis issuance, is linked to an image of a wolf or sheep, as\napplicable. “Woolf Art” means the image of the specific sheep or wolf linked to a particular NFT, which images\nconsists of elements of art compiled by the underlying Sheep Game smart contract. For avoidance of doubt, the\nWoolf Art is digital in nature and does not include, is not linked to, and is not sold together with, any items or\nrepresentations that have physical dimensions such as mass or volume.<br/>\n(a) Additional Terms: Woolfs may be available for purchase on one or more third-party platforms,\nsuch as OpenSea (each, a “NFT Marketplace”), which we do not operate. The access and use of the\nNFT Marketplace are subject to the separate terms of the NFT Marketplace.<br/><br/><br/>\n2. <strong>Ownership of Woolf.</strong><br/>\n(a) When Purchaser acquires a Woolf, Purchaser owns all personal property rights to that Woolf\n(e.g., the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that Woolf). The Woolf Art, however, is free for\nuse by anyone for any purpose without restriction under copyright law. Public domain is the purest form\nof open and free, since no one owns or controls the material in any way.<br/><br/>\n(b) Purchaser represents and warrants that it will not transfer a  Woolf in any subsequent\ntransaction to a Transferee that is (i) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo,\nor that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; or is (ii) listed on\nany U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties (“Prohibited Transferees”).<br/><br/><br/>\n3. <strong>Fees and Payments</strong><br/>\n(a) If you elect to purchase a Woolf through the website, any financial transactions that you engage in will\nbe conducted solely through the Avalanche network. We will have no insight into or control over these\npayments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions.  We will have no\nliability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any\ntransactions that you engage or any other transactions that you conduct via the Avalanche network.<br/><br/>\n(b) Avalanche requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on\nthe Avalanche network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized\nAvalanche network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.<br/><br/><br/>\n4. Transfers. All subsequent transactions of the Woolfs are subject to the following terms: (a) the Woolf\ntransferee (the “Transferee”) shall, by purchasing, accepting, accessing or otherwise using the Woolf or Woolf\nArt, be deemed to accept all of the terms of this Agreement as a “Purchaser” hereof; and (b) the Woolf transferor\n(the “Transferor”) shall provide notice to the Transferee of this Agreement, including a link or other method by\nwhich the terms of this Agreement can be accessible by the Transferee. Purchaser further acknowledges and\nagrees that all subsequent transactions of the Woolf will be effected on the blockchain network governing the\nWoolf, and Purchaser will be required to make or receive payments  exclusively  through its  cryptocurrency\nwallet.<br/><br/><br/>\n5. <strong>The Sheep Game Developers’  Rights  and Obligations to the  Woolf Art  and Woolfs.</strong> The Parties\nacknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for repairing, supporting, replacing, or maintaining any\nwebsite.<br/><br/><br/>\n6. <strong>Warranty Disclaimers and Assumption of Risk.</strong> Purchaser represents and warrants that it (a) is the\nage of majority in Purchaser’s place of residence (which is typically 18 years of age in most U.S. states) and has\nthe legal capacity to enter into this Agreement, (b) that Purchaser will use and interact with the Woolfs and\nWoolfs Art only for lawful purposes and in accordance with this Agreement, and (c) that Purchaser will not use\nthe Woolfs or Woolfs Art to violate any law, regulation or ordinance or any right of The Sheep Game Developers,\nits licensors or any third party, including without limitation, any right of privacy, publicity, copyright, trademark, or\npatent.

The Sheep Game Developers  are  not  responsible  for\ndetermining or paying the taxes that apply to such transactions.<br/><br/>\n(b) We do not store, send, or receive cryptocurrency assets. Any transfer of cryptocurrency\nassets occurs within the supporting blockchain that is not controlled by us.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the\nJAMS Rules, and The Sheep Game Developers won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees The\nSheep Game Developers is responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.

To the extent that you or The Sheep Game Developers\nprevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and\neffect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such\nrelief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
